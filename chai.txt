Adoption Strategy:
- Start on college campuses.
- Manually create meets for student organization meetings and other happenings on campus
- Get together a set of early adopters that post events, and create awareness by handing out free chai.


Competition:
- How do differentiate:
    ->  meetup.com too large, formal, signup fee.
    -> dtl: focuses only on interacting with people you already know.
    -> Meeting new people under an informal setting then falls under dating apps...


Competitive Advantage:

- Have experience creating get-togethers for students and studying behavior (link-to-chai-exps)
- Access to student bodies at multiple universities (Gatech, Berkeley) (Gatech, Berk, Indian Universities)

Team:
- Currently myself (Karthik Uppuluri) with most of the development efforts. Help from Sandeep (Berk) with
initial launch marketing, Faisal (Gatech, Google) with some back-end work, and partnered with
an independent designer in India for the app design.


Why now?

enabling tech?

consumer behavior? -->

distribution channels?
