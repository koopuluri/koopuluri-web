Snapchat and Design Analysis (Change title to be more general):

Some pre-notes:
-->  This is my OPINION about the change in UI WITH RESPECT TO ME. That's all.
No need to justify why it's a bad shift for everyone. Just why I don't like it.
Acknowledge the other side (as to why the move might make sense for  SC, and
potentially users as well), but why I think the move makes SC less unique.

Outline:
- I love Snapchat (Quick reasons for why).

- Latest update and why that reduces the utility I derive:
    - Content is fed down friends' throats -> making it more effortful
    for me to post content.

    First I'll go over the previous Snapchat UI and what I love about it
    --> what makes it unique: (plug in pointX).

    The new change in the UI takes the focus slightly away from content creation.
    Because it's easier to mindlessly consume content.
    I agree that it makes sense from a "business" standpoint, but it doesn't
    flow well with me.

    - It's a step away from the focus of content creation that I love about
    Snapchat.

    - I don't like to consume content that I didn't plan to - this UI change
    makes it too easy to accidentally swallow content.

- Conversation about how much freedom is provided to users of software:
    - I lean towards limiting options (for decision paralysis reasons), but
    up to a certain point: the point beyond which the experience fails to
    provide utility anymore.

    - "Call to Action"s are important and I believe them to be part of a good
    user experience.

        - What is a Call to Action? And how does that relate exactly to the
        Snapchat UI?

        - What fucking point are you trying to make here?

X- Notable features of Snapchat's UI:
    - 3 view structure. (Just the right number).

    - First screen is Camera screen, and every other view flows back to this
    main screen. This is unique in the sense that it pushes a user to create
    content - it's the easiest thing to on the app.

    This is interesting to me: Facebook, Instagram, Reddit, Pinterest all have
    a bias towards content consumption. I lump all of these apps into the
    category of (sharing content between people).

    One could argue that Snapchat is a communications platform and therefore
    it makes sense that creating content to communicate is up front and center
    (as creating a message is the main function of a messaging app), but it's
    grown far beyond that now - with the addition of "stories", snapchat has
    crossed over into the consumption space.

    This is something that I love about Snapchat - it makes it stupidly easy to
    create content. I open the app, and it's ready for me to capture the world
    around me... and then I can choose who to share that moment(s) with. The
    sharing is more of an afterthought, the creation of content is central.


- Conclusion / further research:
    - A platform in which you must create content in order to consume it. I wonder
    what that would be like.

        - What kind of content?

        - What would be the motivation to create? To be able to consume? Is that
        the "right" incentive? What is "right" (the ideal utility for users)?
