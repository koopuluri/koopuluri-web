			<h4>Why?</h4>

			<p> Things I've heard: </p>

			<blockquote>"I'm a new student. Going to clubs and huge events is kind of a lot of effort to meet new people."</blockquote>
			<blockquote>"I just need a person to play ping pong with this afternoon."</blockquote>
			<blockquote>"After I started work, it's been tough to meet new people outside of work, and outside of my professional interests"</blockquote>
			<blockquote>"I had 20 mins to kill before class on Wednesday and tried to talk to this girl at a coffee table next to me about her project. She said she was too busy. Bummer."</blockquote>

			<p class="bold">There are many opportunities for casual interactions around me everyday that currently don't have avenues to tap into.</p>

			<p> I prefer conversations in smaller, more intimate settings over interactions at large events. This is an attempt to increase intimate interactions for the entire community.</p>

			<h4>Path Leading to This:</h4>

			<p>Since I came to college, I've made an attempt ot meet strangers around me. Many of my friends are those that I met inorganically (not through mutual friends) - at coffee shops, basketball courts, streets, cafeteria tables, etc. But initiating conversations randomly isn't as easy as it can be.
			<p>

			<p><a href="http://www.koopuluri.com/chai">This past summer, a friend and I made chai and posted on a Berkeley facebook group a few times over the course of a week and had many students come over to our place for chai and conversation.</a></p>

			<p>Students enjoyed meeting other students around them. The conversations were great and I felt good for opening my space for those interactions</p>

			<p>When I got back to Georgia Tech, I wanted to generalize the idea of meeting other students with an app in which students could post what they were doing at a particular time, and others students could join them if they were interested: <a href="https://meet-at-tech.herokuapp.com">https://meet-at-tech.herokuapp.com</a></p>

			<p>It was clear that anonymity wouldn't work - meeting strangers without knowing anything about them is a tough proposition. The motivation behind anonimity was to remove the bias people have when meeting new people based on superficial features of a person: eg. what they look like, their gender, interests, etc.</p>

			<p>The current version of this experiment is to better understand the dynamics at play here with a more natural interface to interact with others. It reduces the intimidation of meeting new people with profiles and a way to chat before actually meeting. </p>

			<p>Gotta keep learning. Forever a student of the game.</p>

			<h4>Cool, What Next?</h4>

			<p> I believe there's something tremendously valuable here for many people including myself.</p>

			<p>I'd greatly appreciate any feedback!</p>
