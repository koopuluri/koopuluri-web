First two text blocks need a little spicing up.
The second one is three short sentences and the last sentence is missing a period. \\

The demos of the app look awesome (maybe slow down the speed a bit, your descriptions are hilarious,
but then again reading the event descriptions isn't really your goal here),
but
\begin{opinion}
I think a demo is a good opportunity to tell a story.
So you could follow one "meet" all the way through, starting with creation from one perspective,
joining from another and the whole chat thing. And I think if you did it well it wouldn't be cheesy.

"There are many opportunities for casual interactions around me everyday that
currently don't have avenues to tap into." -> don't end sentences with prepositions \\

" This is an attempt to increase intimate interactions for the entire community."
-> switch "for" to "within" or something. Also, I don't think you're necessarily trying to increase
interactions, you're increasing the opportunities for them? Maybe? \\

"But initiating conversations randomly isn't as easy as it can be." This is a weird sentence. \\
"The conversations were great and I felt good for opening my space for those interactions"
Missing a period and also "for" isn't the right word here. Maybe "about"? \\

"The motivation behind anonimity was to remove the bias people have when meeting new people"
->"The motivation behind anonymity was to remove the bias people have before meeting others" \\
"with a more natural interface to interact with others" interact sounds like it's describing
interface, not the user. \\

The sense of humor you showed in the demos was by far my favorite part,
if you can find other places to pepper in some humor then you should definitely do that.
