			<p>
				Creating content, whether it's a post / piece of software / basketball move / product,
				forces me to think deeper.
			<p>

			<div>
				It forces me to answer questions like:
				<ul>
					<li>Why am I saying this?</li>
					<li>What point am I trying to make?</li>
					<li>How is this useful?</li>
				</ul>

			</div>

			<p>
				When I consume content on the other hand, I'm not forced into this deep thinking mode.
				I've caught myself consuming content at a superficial level many times. That's not a
				good way to spend my time. [1]
			</p

			<p>
				To gain value from the content I consume, I need to read critically. But I come across another
				problem going down this path:
			<p>

			<p class="bold">
				Many times, after reading something critically, when I attempt to write my opinions / criticisms about it,
				I notice holes in my thought process - it's usually underthought. I've probably cheated myself
				of true understanding many times because I "felt" that I understood something when I really didn't.
			<p> 

			<p>
				This is where writing my thoughts helps me out - by forcing me to have a deeper understanding
				of what I've just consumed - because it's easier to spot my bullshit when it's dumped on a paper or
				computer screen, and once I spot my bullshit, I can't shift my attention until I think it through.
			</p>

			<p>
				My desire to increase my content creation was the motivation behind <a href="/xnote">Xnote</a>.

			<h2>Notes:</h2>

			<div>
			[1] There still might be room for consuming content at a superficial level - for relaxation purposes.
			I'm not sure though, because I'm too far away from that end to have any knowledge of my "requirement" for
			superficial consumption. I have a feeling though that there really isn't any room for superficial consumption - 
			I feel most relaxed when I am absorbed into something I'm doing - when I give it my full attention. 
			<p> I'll found out when I get there. </p>
