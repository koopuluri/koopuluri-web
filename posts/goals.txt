I'm at a junction.

I want to move forward with Meet@Tech, but runway is non-existent.
I'm not in a position to raise money for it (haven't launched yet, no metrics,
little validation). I'm leaning towards making money in a traditional sense
and building the skills and validating Meet@Tech on the side until I create the
opportunity to step into.

Alright. Until then, I'm going to optimize following skills:

    - Communication Skills:
        - verbal, written.

    - Product design (figuring out what the fuck users want /
    best way to design solution for given problem)

    - Organizational skills:
        - how to best operate a team?
        - growing a team and company

    - Leadership skills:
        - Learn how to lead a team
        - getting my point across and getting support for a direction (if I
        believe that it's the best for the organization).

Best place to do that at an accelerated pace: --> a startup.

It's a lifestyle choice that I feel is biased towards a greater learning rate.

Join an early stage startup tackling a stupidly ambitious and worthy goal:
--> early as in: raised / are raising money and about 5 - 10 people.

^ This would be the ideal situation.

Make an attempt to do so. Nothing to lose here! Make it happen Karthik. Make
it happen.

Be stupidly persistent with a company. Like stupidly persistent --> experiment
with persistence to a level of obnoxiousness haha. I really want to see
to what extent this is socially acceptable.

Remember Meet@Tech's 2 year span!

Next few years --> optimize the shit out of your learning rate.
