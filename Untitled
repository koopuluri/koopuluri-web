Puzzle 1:

A passage.
in source code --> can unhide a button and it highlights a character on each line
that when put together gives a /jkjl somethign url. But this isn't the right one,
the right url is what the class names are for the spans of the individual characters.

There will be lines in the passage that point to how the reality isn't what
is evident to the eyes, must dig deeper...

and link the wrong url to - "This isn't the right page - you've followed
the shallow, superficial truth. You must dig deeper. Follow your heart, not
your mind."

OK. once at the right page:

Puzzle 2:

"Ah, so you've learned how to see through the superficial. Remove the ignorance
that clouds your mind. This will require you to brave the nature that pushes
and pulls all of us in many directions.

There is a place, not too far away. A place filled with more color than any other.
Where one long night was spent learning of the physical forces in the universe.
Climb to the top - "

MRDC top floor (right before the roof - stick a note somewhere up high).

Puzzle 3:

/Now you have a challenge that most mortals would shun away from. Social norms
are a veil that hide our true selves. We must break free and be who we
are meant to be. No word is a waste; everything has a purpose.

end: "Dude, if you found this and weren't looking for it, please just stick it
back, it's for a scavenger hunt thing. K thankx bai. Oh, if you want some chai
hit me up at 770-548-4706"
